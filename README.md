## Introduction

SignTools is a sideloading platform that takes a different approach from any similar tools. It consists of two components â€” a **service** and a **builder**. The builder is a macOS machine which performs signing using official Apple software. Doing so means high reliability and compatibility. The service (this repo) can be hosted anywhere, and it provides a web interface for you to upload, sign, and download apps, using the builder where necessary. Having the web service means that you don't need anything installed on your phone, and you can still sideload without a computer.
